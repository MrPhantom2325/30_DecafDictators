A significant challenge in healthcare today is the reliability and timeliness of test reports from radiologists. Many reports may lack accuracy due to the commercialization of the medical industry, and even accurate reports can be delayed. Patients often have no trustworthy way to verify their results or receive guidance on potential illnesses. To address this, propose a CHATBOT that analyzes PDF test samples (like blood tests) and generates a comprehensive report. This chatbot will not only verify the findings but also provide actionable suggestions for further steps regarding the patient's health.
